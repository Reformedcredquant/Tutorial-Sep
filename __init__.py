_init_.py tells Python that a directory can be imported as a package. _init_.py should start with a docstring for the whole module. As in readme, the docstring should contain an elevator page for your project, and some example usage. You should have a version for your project. The viable is usually _version_ and you should use semantic versioning, which means first number is the major number, stable API, second number is a minor version, editions only, and the last one is patch level. The version itself is usually a simple string, but it can be a more complex object like Python's sys.version_info. We'll cover versioning in depth in other episodes. Apart from that, you can have some code in _init_.py. Some people like to keep _init_.py clear of code and import all the functions and classes from other sub-models, and that' okay as well. _init_.py can be empty, and for sub-packages, it's okay. But make sure that top-level _init_.py has some content.
